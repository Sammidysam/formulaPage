===========

Just a little thing I'm working on for Alg II H at WL.

For standard users
------------------

Just download the PDF. If you have any suggestions, add an issue (see the toolbar near top of page).

For advanced users
------------------

Make sure you have TikZ, polynom, and amsmath installed before trying to compile. 
You will have to compile
twice to get the graphs to look right because of how TikZ works. Other than that, have fun!
